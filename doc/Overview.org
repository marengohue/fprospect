* FProspect overview and purpose
  The general purpose of FProspect is to have a simple to deploy low configuration
  search engine that could be used as a locally-hosted search engine implementation.

  Ideally, it's API should mimic the one of Azure Search to allow for limited development use.
  The goal is to achieve a system that could be ran inside a container on a local development machine
  to remove the external search engine dependency when developing.
